[+] Added an event listener to index.js to actually do something when the
submit button is clicked on the form for the main page.

[+] Since the form is not currently being sent anywhere, the form data is simply
presented to the user through an alert dialog.

[+] Added Google Analytics to index.html for analytic tracking. Google Analytics
is useful to add onto my website because it useful to track how long a visitor
stays on my portfolio page. For instance, if a recruiter visits my portfolio but
only spends 15 seconds on it, I know that the website was probably not appealing
initially so the recruiter decided not to spend more time on it.

This is perhaps the most useful metric as I can use this information to improve
my portfolio site based on where a recruiter may have stopped caring about the
information so that the information I include on the website is clear and concise.
